Software Vision: To enhance the library management system and make the readers or users easy to reserve the books online so that they can collect the books either from the library or they can choose the delivery option where the books can also be delivered to their address. This page allows librarians to log into the system using a username and password. This page displays a list of all books currently in the library inventory. Each book listing should display essential information like title, author, and may be even the cover page (if uploaded). Search and filter functionalities are implemented to allow librarians to easily find specific books.
